# LGMVIP--DataScience-Task-Number-3
# Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

This project focuses on predicting and classifying data using the Decision Tree algorithm. It demonstrates how to create a Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose is to create a classifier that can predict the right class for new data based on learned patterns.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Iris dataset, which is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning. It contains measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) of 150 Iris flowers from three different species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica). The dataset is widely used for classification tasks and serves as a great starting point for learning various machine learning algorithms.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `Prediction_using_Decision_Tree_Algorithm.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required to run the project.

## Installation and Setup

To run this project locally, please follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.x and pip installed.
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
4. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal or command prompt.
5. Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
6. Launch Jupyter Notebook by executing the command `jupyter notebook`.
7. Open `iris_classification.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
8. Follow the instructions in the notebook to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, train a classification model, and evaluate its performance.

## Resources
